This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Before Started

First, add your icon in public and map to manifest.
This is example repo for example PWA in next.js with "next-pwa" lib. 

```
npm install
```

For install package before we start.

## Getting Started

Generate service worker file with build, and run with start.
```

npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Google Lighthouse
You can check your PWA with "Google Lighthouse". If everything alright, you would see this picture.
